#' Filter known covariates
#'
#' This function filters out the known covariates that are captured well by the inferred covariates (unadjusted R squared greater than or equal to 0.9 by default). We use unadjusted R squared instead of adjusted R squared because we do not want to penalize for model complexity here.
#'
#' @param knownCovariates The known covariate matrix (must be observation by feature).
#' @param inferredCovariates The inferred covariate matrix, e.g., the top PCs (must be observation by feature as well). The rows (i.e., observations) in knownCovariates and inferredCovariates must match.
#' @param unadjustedR2_cutoff The cutoff value for unadjusted R squared.
#' @param verbose Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then some detailed messages are printed when the function is run.
#'
#' @return This function returns the filtered known covariates, i.e., the known covariates that should be kept.
